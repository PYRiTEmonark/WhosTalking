punchline: See Discord voice activity indicators directly on your party list.
description: >-
    Once installed, join a Discord voice channel and an XIV party, and have people put their character names in their
    Discord nicknames (or configure things manually in the plugin settings). You should get colourful outlines around
    the job icons on the party list: green for talking, blue for muted, red for deafened, and yellow for unknown name.


    Note that you'll get a permission prompt mentioning "StreamKit Overlay" â€“ this is expected.
